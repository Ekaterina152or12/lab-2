The picturesque mountainous region of South Sulawesi, 
in Indonesia, is home to an ethnic group called the 
Toraja. A large number of its members live in the regency
 of Tana Toraja or "the Land of Toraja" at the center of 
the island of Sulawesi, 300 km north of Makassar, the 
provincial capital of South Sulawesi.

These simple people who practise animism – the view that
 all non-human entities such as animals, plants, and even
 inanimate objects or phenomena possess a spiritual essence,
 have developed some of the most elaborate funeral rites in 
the world. These include tree burials reserved for infants 
who died before teething, and parading of mummies who died 
decades ago.

Toraja funeral rites are important social events and occasions
 for entire families to gather, and for villagers to participate
 in communal events, renewing relationships and reconfirming beliefs
 and traditions in the way of the ancestors. These events last for several days.
